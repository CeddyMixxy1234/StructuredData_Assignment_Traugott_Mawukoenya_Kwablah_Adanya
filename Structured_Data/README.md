# Personal Expense Tracker Dataset

## Description

This dataset tracks my daily expenses over one week. Each row represents a transaction I made, including the date, spending category, payment method, and amount in Ghanaian cedis (GHS).

## Dataset Columns

1. **Date** – When the transaction happened.  
2. **Category** – The type of expense (Food, Transport, Airtime, etc.).  
3. **Amount (GHS)** – The amount spent in Ghanaian cedis.  
4. **Payment Method** – The method used to pay (Cash, MoMo, or Card).  
5. **Description** – A short note about what the expense was for.

## Why It’s Structured Data

This dataset is structured because:

- It is organized into rows and columns.  
- Each column has a clear data type (date, number, text).  
- The formatting is consistent and easy to analyze in tools like Excel or Python.

## Insights

- I spent most of my money on **Food** and **Transport**.  
- **MoMo** was my most frequently used payment method.
