\# Reflection on Structured Data Assignment



Creating my personal expense tracker helped me understand what makes data structured. My dataset was organized in a table format where each column represented a specific attribute such as date, category, amount, and payment method. The structure made it easy to read, analyze, and even visualize patterns like where most of my money went during the week.



One challenge I faced was ensuring consistency in data entry. For example, I sometimes typed “MoMo” differently or left blank cells, which made the dataset messy. I had to clean it by correcting spellings, ensuring all dates used the same format, and avoiding empty rows. This process showed me the importance of data cleaning in maintaining accuracy.



Structured data like this can be used in real-world scenarios such as budgeting applications, financial analytics, or mobile banking platforms. For instance, an app could automatically categorize expenses and show users where they spend the most. 



Overall, I learned that the structure of data determines how easily it can be used for decision-making. Without proper organization, even valuable data becomes difficult to interpret. This exercise made me appreciate why data scientists spend so much time cleaning and structuring data before analysis.
